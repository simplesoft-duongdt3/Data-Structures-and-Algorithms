Key Points
• Trees share some similarities to linked lists, but, whereas linked-list nodes may
only link to one successor node, a tree node can link to many child nodes.
• Every tree node, except for the root node, has exactly one parent node.
• A root node has no parent nodes.
• Leaf nodes have no child nodes.
• Traversals, such as depth-first and level-order traversals, work on multiple types
of trees. However, the implementation will be slightly different based on how the
tree is structured.
